- ## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:
	- ### Preamble
		- **Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a unique product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.**
		- In simpler terms:
			- Every number can be broken down into prime numbers (numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves) through **prime factorization**.
			- This factorization is **unique** for each number, meaning that there’s only one way to express a number as a product of primes (except for the order of the factors).
			- The phrase "up to the order of the factors" means that the order in which the prime factors are listed does not matter when expressing the product. In other words, two factorizations are considered the same if they consist of the same prime numbers, even if the primes are listed in a different order.
			    
			  For example:  
			- The number 12 can be factored as 2×2×3  or 3×2×2
			- Both factorizations are considered the same because they involve the same prime factors, 2, 2 and 3, just in a different order.
			    
			  This principle is a reflection of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization, but the order of the prime factors is not important.  
		- The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** is one of the most important concepts in number theory, and it can be explained simply as follows:
	- ### Examples:
		- **Example with the number 30**:
			- 30 can be written as the product of primes:
			  30=2×3×5  
			- Here, 2, 3, and 5 are all prime numbers.
			- The **prime factorization** of 30 is **unique** because there is no other set of prime numbers that multiply together to give 30.
		- **Example with the number 60**:
			- 60 can be written as:
			  60=2×2×3×5=60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5  
			- This is the **only way** to express 60 as a product of prime numbers.
	- ### Key Points:
		- **Prime Numbers**: Numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.
		- **Prime Factorization**: Breaking a number down into the product of prime numbers.
		- **Uniqueness**: The way we factor a number into primes is unique, meaning there is only one correct way to do it.
	- ### Why is it important?
		- The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** is the foundation for many areas of mathematics because it tells us that prime numbers are the "building blocks" of all numbers. No matter how large or complex a number is, you can always break it down into primes, and this breakdown will always be the same.
			- ### Example with 12:
				- 12 can be written as:
				  12=2×2×312 = 2 × 2 × 3  
				- This is the **only way** to write 12 as a product of prime numbers. We can't do it any other way.
	- ### Applications
		- Here are some **simpler applications** of the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** that are more accessible and relatable:
		- ### 1.  **Prime Factorization**
		- **Breaking down numbers**: The most straightforward application is **finding the prime factorization** of a number. For example, for 60, we can use the theorem to express it uniquely as the product of primes:
		  60=2×2×3×560 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5  
		    
		  This process is fundamental in many areas of math, from simple arithmetic to more advanced topics.  
		- ### 2.  **Simplifying Fractions**
		- **Reducing fractions**: When simplifying fractions, you can use the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. For instance, to simplify 3660frac{36}{60}, first factorize both numbers:
		  36=2×2×3×3,60=2×2×3×536 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3, quad 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5  
		  Cancel out the common factors (in this case, 2×2×32 × 2 × 3), leaving you with:  
		  3660=35frac{36}{60} = frac{3}{5}  
		  This process uses the theorem to ensure you get the simplest form of a fraction.  
		- ### 3.  **Finding Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**
		- **GCD of two numbers**: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic helps when finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). For example, to find the GCD of 24 and 36:
			- Factorize both numbers:
			  24=2×2×2×3,36=2×2×3×324 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3, quad 36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3  
			- The common factors are 2×2×32 × 2 × 3, so the GCD is 1212.
		- ### 4.  **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**
		- **LCM of two numbers**: The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all primes appearing in the factorization of both numbers. For example, to find the LCM of 12 and 18:
			- Factorize both numbers:
			  12=2×2×3,18=2×3×312 = 2 × 2 × 3, quad 18 = 2 × 3 × 3  
			- The LCM is 2×2×3×3=362 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 36.
		- ### 5.  **Checking for Divisibility**
		- **Divisibility rules**: You can use the prime factorization to quickly check if a number is divisible by another. For example, if you want to check if 30 is divisible by 15:
			- Factorize both numbers:
			  30=2×3×5,15=3×530 = 2 × 3 × 5, quad 15 = 3 × 5  
			- Since 3030 contains the prime factors of 1515, 30 is divisible by 15.
		- ### 6.  **Prime Number Identification**
		- The Fundamental Theorem helps **identify prime numbers**. A prime number is a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 29 is prime because it cannot be factored into smaller primes, and its only divisors are 1 and 29.
		- ### 7.  **Understanding Square Numbers**
		- **Square numbers**: The theorem helps us recognize when a number is a perfect square. For example, to determine if 36 is a perfect square, you can find its prime factorization:
		  36=2×2×3×336 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3  
		  Since the prime factors come in pairs (two 2’s and two 3’s), 36 is a perfect square.  
		- ### 8.  **Simplifying Algebraic Expressions**
		- In algebra, you often need to simplify expressions. For instance, if you have 8x24yfrac{8x}{24y}, you can simplify by finding the prime factorization of the numbers:
		  8=2×2×2,24=2×2×2×38 = 2 × 2 × 2, quad 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3  
		  After canceling out the common factors (the three 2’s), the expression simplifies to x3yfrac{x}{3y}.  
		- ### 9.  **Understanding Factors and Multiples**
		- The theorem helps clarify the concept of **factors** and **multiples**. For example, if you are looking for the factors of 20, you know they are the products of the primes that divide 20:
		  20=2×2×520 = 2 × 2 × 5  
		  So, the factors of 20 are 1,2,4,5,10,1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 2020.  
		    
		  These applications show how the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic provides a foundational approach to many basic mathematical operations involving numbers, and it makes calculations easier and more systematic.
